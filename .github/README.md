# Fees Management

> Small student fees management system that generates reports to show fees balances:
1. Per student
2. Per class
3. Per the school

## Folder Structure

```
.github -
        - README.md
FeesManagement  -
                - Components
                - Properties
                - Utils
                - Views
                - FeesManagement.csproj
                - Program.cs
```

## How it works

The system does not make use of an SQL Database but rather stores it's data temporarily in memory.
